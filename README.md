Rental_System
=============

This repository exists just to view a sample of my coding knowledge, and is not intended to be downloaded nor usable outside of the full website which I managed.
This project is a simple rental system of assets, which is fully manageable by clients (no admin necessary).  Because this system is no longer being used, I am able to show the details of this small portion that I built.
It is not necessary to include the inner MYSQL connection files, nor other portions of the site, in order to gain an understanding of my skill in creating this application.
